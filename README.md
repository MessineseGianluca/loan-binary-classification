# loan-binary-classification
A relatively young bank is growing rapidly in terms of overall customer acquisition. Majority of these are Liability customers with
varying sizes of relationship with the bank. The customer base of Asset customers is quite small, and the bank WANTS to grow this base
rapidly to bring in more loan business. Specifically, it wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to Personal Loan
customers.
A campaign the bank ran for liability customers last year showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% successes. This has encouraged the
Retail Marketing department to devise smarter campaigns with better target marketing: purpose of the department is to build a model which
helps them to identify potential loan customers, in order to increase interests earnings and reduce costs for the next campaign.
